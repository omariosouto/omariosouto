### "Olá pessoas!" \o/ 👋

My name is Mario Souto from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Front-End Developer since 2015 (also have a past as Open Tibia Server owner). Actually I work as a Front End Engineer at Nubank and have my YouTube Channel where I make it as my personal lab, sharing many stuff there every week :)

Would you like to find me?
